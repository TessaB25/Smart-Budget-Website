Navigating through life can be really difficult.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
As an adult, we have to pay bills, enjoy nightlife,
extracurricular activities, gym life, travel, DoorDash,
and even carry a Starbucks cup.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let’s not forget our commute to work or around town,
by car, public transportation, Uber, or Lyft.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
All of these activities add up to what are called expenses.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That’s why I built this website to help you kids
learn how to manage expenses before adulthood.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This site is also for adults who dislike boring budgeting apps
and want help reaching retirement goals.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Welcome to the Smart Budget Website!
